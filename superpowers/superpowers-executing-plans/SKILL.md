# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**IMPORTANT: Always use explicit tool calls with full parameters:**
- read_file(path="...") with absolute or relative path
- write_file(path="...", content="...") for file creation
- patch(mode="...", path="...", old_string="...", new_string="...") for edits
- search_files(pattern="...", target="content|files") for finding content or files

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** Tell your human partner that Superpowers works much better with access to subagents. The quality of its work will be significantly higher if run on a platform with subagent support. If subagents are available, use superpowers-subagent-driven-development instead of this skill.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file using: read_file(path="PLAN_FILE_PATH")
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create a task tracking list and proceed to execution

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
2. Use appropriate tools: read_file(), write_file(), patch(), or search_files()
3. Run verifications as specified (e.g., read files, search for patterns)
4. Track completion of each task

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers-finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first using: read_file(path="PLAN_FILE_PATH")
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Use available tools explicitly: read_file(), write_file(), patch(), search_files()
- Don't skip verifications - use read_file() or search_files() to verify changes
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **superpowers-using-git-worktrees** - Ensures isolated workspace (creates one or verifies existing)
- **superpowers-writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **superpowers-finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks
