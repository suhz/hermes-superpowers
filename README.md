# Superpowers for Hermes

Superpowers for Hermes is a derivative work based on the original [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) project. The skills have been audited, updated, and converted to use explicit Hermes tool calls (`write_file`, `read_file`, `terminal`, `patch`, `search_files`, `delegate_task`) while preserving the original methodology and workflow.

All rights are reserved to the original obra/superpowers project and its contributors.

> **Synced to [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) v6.0.3** (upstream commit `45c3cc5`, 2026-06-18). See [UPSTREAM-SYNC.md](UPSTREAM-SYNC.md) for the Hermes transformation layer and what is intentionally not ported.

## Overview

Superpowers provides a systematic approach to software development that ensures code quality, test coverage, and reliable delivery. The workflow emphasizes:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **Declarative Planning** - Break work into bite-sized tasks before coding
- **Evidence-Based Development** - Verify before declaring success
- **Parallel Execution** - Dispatch independent tasks concurrently
- **Code Review** - Task-scoped review after each task, plus a final whole-branch review

## How It Works

Superpowers skills are loaded automatically by Hermes when their triggers are detected. Each skill provides:

- Clear objectives and success criteria
- Step-by-step instructions with explicit tool usage
- Tool examples showing correct syntax
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Skills Library

All 14 skills below are **Hermes-native** - they explicitly use Hermes tools:

### Planning Skills

| Skill | Description |

| [receiving-code-review](./superpowers-receiving-code-review/) | Responds to review feedback with technical rigor and verification |

### Completion Skills

| Skill | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [verification-before-completion](./superpowers-verification-before-completion/) | Run verification commands and confirm output before claiming success |
| [finishing-a-development-branch](./superpowers-finishing-a-development-branch/) | Verify tests, present options for merge/PR/cleanup |

### Infrastructure Skills

| Skill | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [using-git-worktrees](./superpowers-using-git-worktrees/) | Creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection |
| [writing-skills](./superpowers-writing-skills/) | Create new skills following best practices |
| [slash-commands](./superpowers-slash-commands/) | Dispatcher for `/superpowers-skill-name` syntax |
| [using-superpowers](./superpowers-using-superpowers/) | Introduction to the skills system and how to use it |

## Tool Reference

All skills use Hermes-native tools with explicit parameter syntax:

| Tool | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `write_file` | Create or replace files completely | `write_file(path="src/main.py", content="code here")` |
| `read_file` | Read file content with pagination | `read_file(path="README.md", offset=1, limit=100)` |
| `terminal` | Run shell commands | `terminal(command="pytest tests/", timeout=60)` |
| `patch` | Targeted find-and-replace edits | `patch(path="file.py", old_string="old", new_string="new")` |
| `search_files` | Search for files or content | `search_files(pattern="def test_", target="files", path="src/")` |
| `delegate_task` | Parallel subagent dispatch | `delegate_task(tasks=[{goal: "...", context: "..."}])` |
| `todo` | Track task progress | `todo(todos=[{id: "t1", content: "...", status: "pending"}])` |

## Getting Started

Superpowers triggers automatically based on your conversation. You don't need to install anything manually.

## Onboarding for Hermes

When using Superpowers with Hermes Agent, the skills are loaded automatically. No manual installation or configuration required.

**For New Users:**
1. Superpowers detects skill triggers and loads the appropriate skill
2. The skill provides explicit, step-by-step instructions
3. Follow the skill's guidance - all tool calls are specified
4. Skills integrate seamlessly with Hermes' existing tools (`write_file`, `read_file`, `terminal`, `patch`, `search_files`, `delegate_task`)

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automatic Activation:** Skills trigger based on conversation context
- **Hermes-Native:** All tool references use Hermes-specific syntax
- **No Configuration Required:** Works out of the box with Hermes
- **Explicit Instructions:** Every step shows exactly which tool to use and how

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "Help me plan this feature"
→ [writing-plans] activates automatically
→ Creates comprehensive implementation plan with explicit tool calls
→ [subagent-driven-development] or [executing-plans] activates
→ Executes with proper tool usage (write_file, terminal, patch, etc.)
→ Work complete with verification
```

**Trigger patterns:**
- "Let's plan this" → `writing-plans` activates
- "How should I implement this?" → `test-driven-development` activates
- "Something's wrong" → `systematic-debugging` activates
- "Help me review this" → `requesting-code-review` activates
- "All done, what's next?" → `finishing-a-development-branch` activates

**Optional explicit invocation:**
You can also trigger skills directly with the skill prefix:
- "Use `/superpowers-brainstorming` to explore options"
- "Use `/superpowers-writing-plans` to create a plan"

## Migration Notes

**For Users Coming From Claude/Codex:**
These skills were originally designed for Claude Code but have been converted to work with Hermes Agent. The core concepts and workflows are identical, but all tool references have been updated:

- Shell commands → `terminal(command="...")`
- Generic "Read file" → `read_file(path="...")`
- Generic "Create file" → `write_file(path="...", content="...")`
- Bash operations → `patch(path="...", old_string="...", new_string="...")`

All skills now provide explicit, copy-pasteable tool examples that work reliably with Hermes.

**Changes Made for Hermes Compatibility:**
- Removed all bash/shell code blocks → explicit `terminal(command="...")` syntax
- Replaced generic "Read file" → explicit `read_file(path="...")` syntax
- Replaced generic "Create file" → explicit `write_file(path="...", content="...")` syntax
- Updated all tool references to use Hermes-native parameter formats
- Added "Onboarding for Hermes" section explaining automatic skill activation
